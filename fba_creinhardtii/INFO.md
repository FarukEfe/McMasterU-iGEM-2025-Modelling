Key takeaways for FBA:

1. Identify key pathways for overexpression
    a. we already know which pathways we're targeting
2. Predict bottlenecks
    a. see which pathways limit/compete with our targets
    b. can help us with gene knockout or gene under expression
3. Predict ergosterol production
4. Optimized media and growth conditions
    a. based off optimal fluxes
