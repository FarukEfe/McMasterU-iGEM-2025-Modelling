### Cholorophyll Concentration in Systems

#### Natural Systems

and Phosphorus on Algal Blooms](https://sci-hub.se/https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127419501293)

- Model assumes mass action kinetics. 
- A model was developed to account for the change in population of the algae and detritious cells based on Nitrogen (N) and Phosphorus (P).
- Assume we have a steady rate of input N and P. In addition, detritious cells contribute back to N and P supply.
- A(t) is affected by supply and overpopulation can kill some of the culture by a rate. This will cause in decrease of A(t) and increase of D(t).
- Check out `C_ALGAE_NAT.md` to see the model steady-state results.

#### Synthetic Systems

- Study demonstrates the steady-state concentration of the algal biomass in PBRs
- Wet biomass concentration (g/L) seems to be upper-bounded by 16 g/L. Taking steady state as 15 g/L is a safe approach, graph clearly shows the concentration exceeds that amount upon steady-state.

- Chlorophyll makes up about 7% of algae composition. Could be used to convert algal concentration into Chl concentration.

As a summary of the 2 articles in `Synthetic Systems` section, we can say that a humble approximation of the chlorophyll concentration would be $15 \space g/L \times 0.07 = 1.05 g \space Chlorophyll/L$

### Chlamydomonas reinhardtii Fixation Rates

- High CO2: $97 \space \mu mol \space CO_2/mg \space Chlorophyll/h$
- Low CO2: $93 \space \mu mol \space CO_2/mg \space Chlorophyll/h$
- Very Low CO2: $49 \space \mu mol \space CO_2/mg \space Chlorophyll/h$

### Chlorella Vulgaris Fixation Rates

### Computation

$CO_2 \space fixed \space (g/h)=(\frac{R_{fixation}\times C_{Chl}\times V\times Mm_{CO_2}}{10^6})$ where,

- $R_{fixation}$ is the determined chlorophyl-based fixation rate ($\mu$ mol CO2/mg Chl/h)
- $C_{Chl}$ is the concentration of chlorophyl (mg Chl/L)
- $V$ as volume in L
- $Mm_{CO_2}$ as the molar mass of CO2 (44.009 g/mol)

- Increasing by \$15 a year and it's estimated that it will reach \$170 per tonne.
- Sits at \$80 per tonne in April 2024.
